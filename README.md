# Scheme interpreter implemented in Standard ML (old project from 1997)

This was a personal project of mine from 1997, imported from a directory
with an RCS repo but without everything actually checked into it.

I made the minimal changes just to make the project compile again with
Standard ML of New Jersey. I haven't looked back at my old code. It looks
undocumented. I don't develop now the way I did 18 years ago!
